{ question: <span>What defines the term 3LGM²?</span>, answers: [<span>Metamodel for developing information system models of health information systems. It distinguishes three layers of information systems: domain layer, logical tool layer, and physical tool layer. It aims to support the systematic information management and especially the structural monitoring of information processing in health care institutions. 3LGM²-B consists of concepts describing basic elements of a HIS architecture. 3LGM²-M adds concepts for modeling message-based communication. 3LGM²-S provides additional concepts for modeling service-oriented architectures.</span>,<span>An application component is a set of actually usable rules, which control data processing of certain physical data processing systems. Rules are considered to be actually usable, if they are implemented such that they are ready to support certain enterprise functions in a certain enterprise or support communication between application components. If the rules are implemented as executable software, the application component is called computer-based application component. Otherwise it is called non-computer-based.</span>,<span>In the 3LGM², the logical tool layer describes the set of application components used in a health care institution to support its enterprise functions.
